# Problems that need to be solved


During the hackathon weekend we showed that there might be value in doing something like this with GPT-3.

However, a few problems also arose that we'd need to solve if we were to make this system a reality (as opposed to just a research project for a dissertation). These problems stem from the fact that GPT-3 is a ground breaking development in NLP that has far reaching implications and huge potential for misuse. As such, it's use is relatively restricted at the moment. This may change over time as more AI safety research is done, but at the moment, if we use GPT-3, we have to operate within the confines of OpenAI's Usage Agreement. 


## Gaining access to GPT-3 
For the hackathon we used the Warwick AI research account to access the private GPT-3 beta. The Netcraft entity would need its own access.

It may be the case that within the next year or so, access opens up to the public. In that case, this problem would be solved. Until then, we need to gain access. More information can be found here https://beta.openai.com/

### Solution 

Two avenues; 

- Apply: https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30
- Commercial license with Microsoft - this is purely speculative but I feel as though there could be potential here. I'd like to explore this more. 


## ToS Violations 

We unwittingly committed a variety of ToS violations against OpenAI this weekend. From https://beta.openai.com/docs/use-case-guidelines:

Specifically:
- `Applications that extract protected personal information or other sensitive information from data about people.`
- `Applications where an end user is misled to believe that generative responses are coming from a human.` 
- `Applications that serve open-ended outputs to 3rd-parties, such as Tweet generators, Instagram post generators, unconstrained chatbots, or other open-ended text generators`

### Solution

All is not lost;

OpenAI are open to partnerships with applications on the borders of their current "allowed use cases", specifically with entities that have "significant domain experience". 

We could get in touch and offer to trial this project in collaboration with them. If we could prove that it resulted in less cybercrime, it may be taken into consideration.
